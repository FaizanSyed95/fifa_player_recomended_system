# Fifa Player Recomended System
machine learning Fifa recomended web app with flask

# The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.

## Machine Leaning Project of Fifa Player Recomended System with front-end is in flask web fremwork. you can use this system for any other recomeded system like Other Player recomended system. i made this system with the help of Pandas, Numpy and most important Scikit-learn machine learning library. i am using The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

### After you enter player name it will take you to result page where you can see top 5 players similar to input players list.

## Just Download folder and install required python packages and run app.py file
